# VipnodePool manages the payment component of a Vipnode Pool. (https:#vipnode.org)
#
# The payment mechanism can evolve in the future, but the current version holds
# a maximum balance for accounts, and the pool operator is trusted to settle
# that balance periodically based on internal accounting.
#
# Pool operators may impose their own fees during settlement.
#
# Future improvements ideas are outlined at: https:#github.com/vipnode/vipnode-contract

  # the balance and unlock it for withdrawing.
